## Workspace Focus

- The `/workspaces/` folder contains cloned repositories for development
- **ALL coding assistance should be directed towards projects in `/workspaces/`**
- Always check for repo-specific CLAUDE.md files within each workspace
- Respect each repository's individual coding standards and requirements

## Operating Modes
